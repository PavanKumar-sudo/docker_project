# A simple MERN stack application 

This is a simple 3-tier architecture where the frontend, backend, and database are connected.I cloned this repository from another resource and wrote the Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend.
I also wrote a Docker Compose file to connect the frontend, backend, and database.Once everything was set up, I ran the following command:

docker compose up -d

which runs the containers in detached mode.

After running the command, I opened this link in my browser:

http://localhost:5173/

You will see the output like this.
